## Ian. J Moore Sample Work

#### Python1-IMU_Ski_Analysis:
-Developed algorithms in Python by using wearable IMU sensor data to identify specific events during Roller Skiing
-Imports multiple sensor data sets in Python and processes noisy signal using continuous wavelet transforms 

#### Python2-ME003-Intro_to_Robotics:
-Collection of documents and code in support of ME003 that I wrote as the curriculum for a two credit intro-course for Freshmen Engineers with little to no coding experience.
-See ME003-Intro_Python_Master.ipynb for bulk of intro coursework
-See SimRobot/ME003-SimBot-1.ipynb for simulated robot code 

#### C++DDRobot_ISR:
-Final project in Embedded Systems
-Simulated partially autonomous vehicle with automatic breaking overriding user control through Arduino C++ ISR

#### SolidWorks: 
-F-16 nose gear assembly
-Favorite aircraft
-After doing a pen and paper Failure Modes Analysis in Design of Elements, on the vertical connecting rod of the F-16 nose gear, I made the assembly in SolidWorks.
