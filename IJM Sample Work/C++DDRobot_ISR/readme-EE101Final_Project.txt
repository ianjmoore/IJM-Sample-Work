EE101Final_Project.ino : EE101L - Digital Control Lab
The objective which this project aims to solve is simulating a pedestrian or obstacle in front of a moving autonomous vehicle. 
As an analogous system, like a Tesla, a person has control over the vehicle, but the vehicle ultimately will avoid a collision 
via software and hardware through an Interrupt Service Routine (ISR).

1. 0:00 - 0:03 Shows forward drive (caster was stuck so veered right)
2. 0:03 - 0:04 Shows ISR due to input from Ultrasonic Ranging sensor to board to wheels causing pause and reverse of bot
