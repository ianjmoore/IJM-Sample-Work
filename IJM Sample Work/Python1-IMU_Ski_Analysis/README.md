## Python1-IMU_Ski_Analysis

#### Sensor Data Analyst
UVM Biomedical Engineering Dept. 
-Developed algorithms in Python by using wearable IMU sensor data to identify specific events during overground Nordic Skiing
-Imports 18 data sets in Python and processes noisy signal using continuous wavelet transform and windowing algorithm
-Unfortunately I am not able to include the raw data as it is IRB protected, yet I can provide an in person demonstration for especially curious parties.
